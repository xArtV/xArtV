### Hello, friend! ðŸ‘‹
I am a beginner __frontend developer__  
A year ago I got acquainted with programming and it fascinated me very much, I completed two courses in web development, studied basic technologies, implemented three non-commercial projects. I have experience working as a graphic designer in a team, which largely determined the choice of frontend as a development direction.
